 <hr />

 <h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
 <p>This movie is set in just one scene and shows how different people perceives the same thing in very different ways based on their culture, past experience.</p>

 <h3>Predestination</h3>
 <p>I just love this thriller due to its unexpected twist. If you just watch it one time you might not get it. I highly recommend this</p>

 <h3>The Green Book</h3>
 <p>This movie shows how a black artist was treated in the past showing different stereotypes he had to break.</p>
